1. Legal PDF Text Extraction & Summarization Pipeline

Developed an autonomous pipeline to extract text from legal PDF documents written in multiple regional languages.

Utilized Hugging Face open-source models for:

OCR and text extraction from scanned legal PDFs.

Translation from regional languages to English.

Summarization of translated legal text into concise, structured outputs.

Automatically appends extracted and summarized content to CSV files for efficient storage and analysis.

2. Multimodal Video Summarization Pipeline

Built a multimodal summarization system that analyzes both visual and audio modalities from videos.

Extracts on-screen text from video frames and transcribes speech using OpenAI Whisper.

Combines both sources into a cohesive, comprehensive summary, providing deeper contextual understanding of the video content.
